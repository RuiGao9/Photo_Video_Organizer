# Photo_Video_Organizer
Personal Used Script to Organize All Pictures and Videos Taken by Different Platforms.

## Workflow
- Step one: move all pictures and videos from the folder (including subfolders) to a single one folder.
- Step two: classify all pictures and videos based on the recording time and put them into different folders based on the time. For example, the created folder is named "202411" if the picture/video was taken in November 2024.

  ### Script 1

- Provide an empty folder where you want to save your organized pictures and videos.
